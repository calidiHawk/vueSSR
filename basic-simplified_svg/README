This is the simpliest example of drawSVG I can make. 


Load Scripts -> Draw Shapes -> Style -> Animate 





At the BOTTOM of index.html I pull in the gsap modules 


	<!-- Local version of TweenMax and DrawSVGPlugin -->
	<script src='TweenMax.min.js'></script>
	<script src="DrawSVGPlugin.min.js"></script>





In the MIDDLE of index.html I go over a few ways of drawing base SVG shapes
(Note: understanding how to work with actual SVG files is more valuable, but this is intended to be the most basic version possible)


	<svg height="100" width="100">
	  <circle class="circle-3" cx="50" cy="50" r="40"/>
	</svg>




In css/style.css we specify the style (one svg shape's style is specified here...the others are inline style)
(NOTE: Gotcha...you have to make sure the stroke is defined before using it, either inline or css)

	.circle-3 {
	  fill: none;
	  stroke: red;
	  stroke-width: 1;
	  stroke-linecap: butt;
	  stroke-dasharray: 0;
	}




In js/index.js we animate finally :) 

	TweenLite.fromTo(".circle-1", 1, {drawSVG:"0 5%"}, {drawSVG:"9% 100%"});
